# Machine-Learning-Daylight-Assessment
The Story : 
Scrolling throght Social Media , i get a text message from an uknown Person , i talk through the person asking for my help , appearantly he found my profile from a Data Science Algerian Group and want help to use machine learning , i accepted since it looked like an oppertunity to Put my skills into test , his demand was as following 
he said that he is an architecture  Phd Student that want to used machine learning instead of the traditional ways to assess Daylight in a space , of course me without any domain knowledge i asked for further explaination and at that time i decided to take onto this new challenge 

My Biggest Challenegs were : 
- Understanding the domain i was in obviously it took me hours of talking and asking questions and reading through article to understand the domain 
- this one is my biggest challenge , which is the person i was talking to had no clue how machine learning works at all so when i ask what's the target column and what do u want to predict , his thoughts goes all over the place 
- also , appearntly his supervisor didn't provide enought metadata about the data he provided , then after contacting him he told me what's the target column which was 
(SDA - ASE) 
- the 4th challenge was Calculating and finding the impact of each column on the model prediction accuracy , which was completly new for me , at that place i learned what is Sentivity Analysis and How to apply it 
- this is also was hard for me , communicating and explaining the machine learning model , from code to algorithms to evaluation algorithm to explaining plots to explaining the sensitivity analysis to a guy that know nothing about machine learning 

The Sad Part is After a month from trying to help that guy , he decides to disappear with no traces left behind him (hehe spooky) but i've tried my best and i've done it all for free and i've learned a lot and got to chance to include this project into my portfolio 

To Assess Daylight in a room using MACHINE LEARNING  i've  : 
- comunnicated and asked a lot of Questions to understand the domain and the task 
- made a lot of reasearches to better understand my data and its variables 
- Cleaned and Prepared Data for the models 
- splitted data into training and test samples 
- used 2 different algorithms and 2 different evaluation techniques and used the best 
- hyper tuned my models parameters 
- Sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of my data variables on the accuracy of the models  
- Finally Communicating my insight and finding through a Machine learning Framework 

To Apply These Skills i used the following tools :
Python to run : machine learning tasks 
Microsoft Word : to Write down and explain my model and my insights
